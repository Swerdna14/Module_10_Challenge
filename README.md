# Module_10_Challenge

In this challenge, crypto market data gets scaled so it is standardised across all of the different crypto coins to make it a fair comparison.

From there, the data is then used to find the best value for the K-Means cluster number by using the Elbow Curve method.
Once it was found, the data was then plotted on a scatterplot to see it visually in its clusters.

To compare it, the PCA method was applied to the original scaled data and the same process of finding the optimal number of clusters through the ELbow Curve method was used.
The PCA dataframe was then plotted on a scatterplot.

The originally scaled data was compared to the PCA data, both the Elbow Curves and Scatterplots were analysed and some questions were answered.
